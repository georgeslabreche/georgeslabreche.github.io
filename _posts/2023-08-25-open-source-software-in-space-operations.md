From the very first use of [deep neural networks onboard a satellite with TensorFlow Lite](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9843402) to some pretty awesome onboard [software defined radio signal processing with GNU Radio and TensorFlow object detection](https://georges.fyi/opssat/machine-learning-for-digital-signal-processing-with-software-defined-radio/), read all about how OPS-SAT-1 has leveraged open source software in space operations:

There's loads to be excited about with the power of open source when it is unleashed on space-bound edge computers. As always, a huge thank you to the OPS-SAT Mission Control Team at the European Space Agency for the boundless opportunities to innovate in space!

Shout-out to my co-author, co-researcher, and friend Tom Mladenov for defying the laws of spacetime by making the time in his crazy schedule to publish something with me.
