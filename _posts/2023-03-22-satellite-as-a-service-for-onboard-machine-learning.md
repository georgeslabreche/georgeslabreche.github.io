I got to present one of our neat projects at this year's [IEEE AeroConf](https://www.aeroconf.org/), developed by my consultancy [Tanagra Space](https://tanagraspace.com/) in collaboration with [VisionSpace](https://www.visionspace.com/) and [ESA-ESOC](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESOC):

> Labr√®che, G., & Alvarez, C. G. (2023). SaaSyML: Software as a Service for Machine Learning On-board the OPS-SAT Spacecraft. In _2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference_, Big Sky, MT, USA, 2023, pp. 1-9, doi: [10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115531](https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115531).

The European Space Agency's OPS-SAT space lab is a versatile platform that enables software engineering using modern web 2.0 best practices. The SaaSyML app provides experimenters with a RESTful API for on-board Machine Learning applications. It's Space Platform as-a-Service (SPaaS)! It implements a publish-subscribe pattern that uses on-board data as training data and can run in-flight inferences with the trained models.

A massive thank you to the OPS-SAT Mission Control Team for all their support in making this experiment a success and a big shout-out to the AeroConf event organizers! Here's [the source code](https://github.com/visionspacetec/opssat-saasy-ml).
