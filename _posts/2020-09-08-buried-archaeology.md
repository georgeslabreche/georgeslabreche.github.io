Check out the pilot study published in [Remote Sensing (Volume 12, Issue 17, September 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/17/2795).

Huge thank you to co-authors Christopher Stewart and Daniel Lombraña González. Massive shout-out to the citizen scientists who participated. Big-up to the PhiLab at European Space Agency (ESA) / ESRIN for providing the enabling environment required to come up and follow through with super cool research projects.

  <figcaption>An example of an archaeological cropmark with two positive detections (see black arrow). This is in proximity to the Via Nomentana. It appears to be a cropmark of a Roman villa, but more data would be needed to verify the nature of the structure.</figcaption>
