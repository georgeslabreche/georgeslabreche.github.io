Check out these machine learning models trained in-orbit onboard the OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft. This was achieved as part of our experiment called [OrbitAI](https://github.com/georgeslabreche/opssat-orbitai):

To our knowledge, this is **the first time an artificial intelligence model is trained onboard a flying mission**. We use a stream of sensor data as real-time training inputs that we feed into Online Machine Learning Algorithms. One of our models already gave us predictions with a whopping 89% balanced accuracy after only a few runs.

The European Space Agency (ESA) has truly provided a fantastically versatile experimenter's platform with the OPS-SAT-1 space lab. Next step is to present our findings at the SpaceOps 2021 conference and publish our research! Be sure to attend, it's online and there's no registration fee.
