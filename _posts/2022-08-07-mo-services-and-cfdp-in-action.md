The OPS-SAT mission has set aside the Packet Utilization Standard (PUS) in favor of a standard being defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS): the Mission Operations (MO) Services and the File Delivery Protocol (CFDP)'s file-based operations. The OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft is the first in-orbit demonstration of fully MO-based on-board software and ground implementations.

Using OPS-SAT as the technology demonstrator for MO Services and CFDP has provided an enormous feedback value to all teams responsible for the design, development, implementation, and operation of those standards. This turned out to be the perfect realization of the core mission principle — to allow rapid advancement of the technology readiness of the software via in-orbit validation and demonstration. OPS-SAT is paving the way for other missions and orbital platforms aiming to adopt those technologies soon, both within ESA and commercial endeavors. The employed solutions ease the mission integration with external users as well as decrease the general system complexity and the maintenance effort, thus increasing the mission return value.
