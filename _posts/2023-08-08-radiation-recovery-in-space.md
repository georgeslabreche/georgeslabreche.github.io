‚ò¢Ô∏èRadiation Recovery... in Space! üõ∞The OPS-SAT-1 mission control team pulled off a super creative recovery from radiation and wear induced memory faults on-board the spacecraft's edge computer payload. Read all about it the poster we presented at Small Satellite Conference (SmallSat):

> Henkel, M., Zelenevskiy, V., Laurinovics, R., Papadatos Vasilakis, O., Evans, D., Labr√®che, G., Marszk, D., & Bammens, S. (2023). Recovery From File System Corruption on the OPS-SAT-1 Experimental Processor. *Proceedings of the 37th Annual Small Satellite Conference*. [https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2023/all2023/263/](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2023/all2023/263/)

The on-board non-volatile memory (eMMC) corruptions as well as the recovery techniques used to restore operations and improve resilience can be generalized as a guideline to many small satellite missions that use non-radiation hard memory.

This was a tremendous effort that involved a lot of talent from the European Space Agency, academia, and industry (check out the affiliations on the poster). For anyone at SmallSat, be sure to reach out to Vladimir Zelenevskiy to chat all about this amazing achievement!

**Update 2024-06-17:** We wrote and published an IEEE paper on this! Check it out:
