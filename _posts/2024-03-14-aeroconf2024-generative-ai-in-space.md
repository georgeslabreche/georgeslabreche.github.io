A few months ago I posted about [the first use of Generative AI in space](https://georges.fyi/opssat/first-use-of-generative-ai-in-space/) to denoise grainy images onboard the OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft and how I applied it to [uplink The Pale Blue Dot back into space for some poetic denoising](https://georges.fyi/opssat/the-denoised-blue-dot/).

Since then, I worked with the Mission Control Team to run the experiment a few more times and ended up with prettier results:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-03-14/img_msec_1697455926224_2_thumbnail.original.jpeg" alt="Original Image 1" width="224"/></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-03-14/img_msec_1697455926224_2_thumbnail.noised.jpeg" alt="Noised Image 1" width="224"/></td>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-03-14/img_msec_1697455926224_2_thumbnail.denoised.jpeg" alt="Denoised Image 1" width="224"/></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><figcaption>Original.</figcaption></td>
      <td><figcaption>Noised.</figcaption></td>
      <td><figcaption>Denoised.</figcaption></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

I also presented our findings at [IEEE AeroConf 2024](https://www.aeroconf.org/) as part of a peer-reviewed paper that will soon be published. Here's a glimpse of the action:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><a href="/assets/images/posts/2024-03-14/aeroconf2024-georges-labreche-generative-ai-in-space-onboard-esa-opssat1-spacecraft.gif"><img src="/assets/images/posts/2024-03-14/aeroconf2024-georges-labreche-generative-ai-in-space-onboard-esa-opssat1-spacecraft.gif" alt="Presenting at IEEE AeroConf 2024: The first use of Generative AI in space onboard the OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft" /></a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="text-align:left;">
      <td><figcaption><strong>Presenting at IEEE AeroConf 2024: The first use of Generative AI in space onboard the OPS-SAT-1 spacecraft.</strong></figcaption></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Check out the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/georgeslabreche/opssat-onboard-image-denoiser) and read the pre-print on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378966767_Generative_AI_in_Space_Adversarial_Networks_to_Denoise_Images_Onboard_the_OPS-SAT-1_Spacecraft).

A huge thanks to the OPS-SAT-1 Mission Control Team as well as to my co-experimenters / co-authors Cesar Guzman and Sam Bammens!
