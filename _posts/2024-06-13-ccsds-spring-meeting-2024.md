Back in May, we gathered at the U.S. Department of Commerce in DC for the Spring 2024 working group of The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). üöÄ

My contributions focused on the area for Mission Operations and Information Management Services (MOIMS). I'm prototyping and promoting the use of next-gen web technologies to modernize and boost CCSDS' international standards for space mission operations. üåê‚ú® More concretely, I'm looking into converting [CCSDS MO Service definitions](https://github.com/esa/nanosat-mo-framework/tree/dev/core/mo-services-xml) into [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/en) equivalents.

The event itself was a fun way to meet people across different space agencies and industry while doing hands on work that will affect how future missions are designed! üõ∞Ô∏èü§ù Learn more about our specific area of work, [here](https://public.ccsds.org/Publications/MOIMS.aspx).

I've worked a lot with CCSDS MO standards while developing onboard and ground software for ESA's OPS-SAT mission. I even helped with defining and [implementing the new CCSDS Housekeeping Data Compression Standard 124.0-B-1](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2022/all2022/133/). You can check out that particular standard, [here](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/124x0b1.pdf). So I'm pretty stoked to be part of the team shaping these standards. üõ†Ô∏è

Thank you Dominik Marszk from ESA/ESOC for including me to the gathering! üôè Thank you to our hosts the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
